One can imagine a queue as a line of people waiting to receive something in sequential order which starts from the beginning of the line. It is an ordered list in which insertions are done at one end which is known as the rear and deletions are done from the other end known as the front. A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.",
